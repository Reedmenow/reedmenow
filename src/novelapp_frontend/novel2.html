        <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <p>In the year 2147, Earth had become a wasteland, ravaged by climate change and war. The last remnants of humanity lived in the floating cities above the clouds. Among them was Elara, a young woman with dreams of exploring the forbidden surface.</p>

        <h2>Page 2</h2>
        <p>Elara snuck out, her heart racing as she approached the wreckage. The ship was covered in strange symbols, glowing faintly in the twilight. Inside, she discovered advanced technology beyond her wildest imagination—a time travel device.</p>

        <h2>Page 3</h2>
        <p>As she wandered through the vibrant landscape, she encountered an alien race known as the Threllians. They had watched Earth’s demise from afar and offered her a choice: return and warn humanity or stay and help rebuild a new civilization.</p>
